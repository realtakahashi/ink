//! Generate principles about the code generation of ink!.
//!
//! The user provided module that has the `#[ink::contract]` is called
//! the ink! module.
//!
//! - User provided definitions such as the `#[ink(event)]` definitions
//!   but also non-ink! definitions shall be re-generated at the root of the ink! module.
//!   The only modification on these user provided definitions is the
//!   removal of `#[ink(..)]` attributes. The only exception to
//!   this rule is the `#[ink(storage)] struct` that is going to be generated
//!   within `__ink_private` module because of required structural changes as
//!   well as to restrict access to certain implementation details.
//! - All utility and helper definitions used exclusively by ink!
//!   shall be defined within the `__ink_private` module that itself
//!   is defined as child of the ink! module. Further sub-modules
//!   inside this structure are allowed to further restrict scopes.
//! - Code genenration shall avoid introducing new names and instead rely on
//!   already given names and definitions or use techniques such as using
//!   generic utility structures and `[(); N]` generics where `N` is a unique
//!   hash of some required entity.
//! - Code shall generated with respect to runtime efficiency to not waste gas
//!   upon contract execution. For this the generated code shall try to use
//!   compile-time execution friendly routines that the compiler is known
//!   to handle efficiently.
//! - Generated code shall never conflict with user provided code. This goes
//!   hand-in-hand with avoiding name clashes but further says that types shall
//!   not implement non-ink! traits if not necessary and instead rely optionally
//!   on the user to define them.
